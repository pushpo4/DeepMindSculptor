# DeepMindSculptor

Welcome to DeepMindSculptor, an innovative repository for creating stunning 3D sculptures using the power of deep learning.

## Introduction

DeepMindSculptor is your gateway to generating intricate 3D sculptures that are as unique as your imagination. This repository leverages deep convolutional neural networks to produce visually appealing sculptures.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python and TensorFlow installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the provided Python script to train the model and create your own 3D sculptures.
4. Explore the generated sculptures and experiment with different settings.

## Code Usage

The main script `sculpture_generator.py` defines a deep learning model for sculpture generation. You can train the model with your own data or generate new sculptures with it.

## Example Output
